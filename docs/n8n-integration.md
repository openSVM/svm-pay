# n8n Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating SVM-Pay with n8n, a powerful workflow automation platform. With this integration, you can automate payment workflows, handle complex business logic, and integrate cryptocurrency payments seamlessly into your existing automation processes.

## What is n8n?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different services and automate tasks. It provides a visual workflow editor and supports custom nodes for extending functionality. With the SVM-Pay integration, you can:

- Automate payment processing based on external events
- Create conditional payment workflows
- Process bulk payments and transfers
- Handle payment notifications and updates
- Integrate with databases, APIs, and other services

## Key Features

### SVM-Pay Custom Nodes

The integration includes several custom nodes:

1. **SVM-Pay Node** - Main payment processing and wallet operations
2. **SVM-Pay Webhook Node** - Handle payment events and notifications
3. **SVM-Pay Batch Node** - Process multiple payments efficiently
4. **SVM-Pay Credentials** - Secure credential management

### Supported Operations

- **Payment Processing**: Create payment requests, process direct payments, verify transactions
- **Webhook Handling**: Receive and process real-time payment events
- **Batch Operations**: Handle bulk payments, payroll distribution, airdrops
- **Wallet Management**: Check balances, manage multiple wallets
- **Token Operations**: Support for USDC, SOL, and custom tokens

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- n8n installed (locally or cloud)
- Node.js 16+ (for local development)
- SVM-Pay account and API credentials
- Basic understanding of workflow automation

### Installing Custom Nodes

1. **Create Node Package**:
```bash
mkdir n8n-nodes-svm-pay
cd n8n-nodes-svm-pay
npm init -y
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
npm install --save n8n-workflow n8n-core @svm-pay/sdk
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
```

3. **Build and Install**:
```bash

```

4. **Restart n8n**:
```bash
n8n start
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up Credentials

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **Credentials**
2. Click **Add Credential** and select **SVM-Pay API**

  3. Route to appropriate handler
  4. Execute business logic
  5. Send notifications
```

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing

The SVM-Pay Batch node supports several batch operations:

- **Batch Payments**: Process multiple payments in optimized batches
- **Bulk Transfers**: Send transfers to multiple recipients
- **Payroll Distribution**: Handle employee payments with metadata
- **Airdrop Campaigns**: Distribute tokens to community members

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling:

- **Continue on Error**: Process remaining items if some fail
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Error Notifications**: Alert administrators of failures
- **Grace Periods**: Handle temporary payment failures

### Monitoring and Analytics

Track workflow performance:

- **Execution Metrics**: Monitor success rates and timing
- **Payment Analytics**: Track volumes and patterns
- **Error Tracking**: Identify and resolve issues quickly
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize batch sizes and timing

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

- Store private keys securely using n8n's credential system
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Rotate API keys and webhook secrets regularly
- Implement proper access controls

### Webhook Security

- Always verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Log and monitor webhook activity

### Network Security

- Use secure networks (Mainnet for production)
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Keep n8n and dependencies updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify network configuration
   - Check API endpoints and credentials
   - Ensure proper firewall settings

2. **Payment Failures**:
   - Verify wallet balances
   - Check token configurations
   - Review transaction limits

3. **Webhook Issues**:
