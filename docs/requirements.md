# SVM-Pay Requirements

## Overview
SVM-Pay is a decentralized payment solution similar to Solana Pay but designed to work across all Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) networks. It aims to be a complete, fee-free alternative to traditional payment processors like Stripe, with easy one-click integration for developers.

## Target Networks
SVM-Pay will support the following SVM networks:
1. **Solana** - The original SVM blockchain with high throughput and low fees
2. **Sonic SVM** - First chain extension on Solana, designed for games and applications
3. **Eclipse** - SVM implementation on Ethereum, combining Solana's performance with Ethereum's liquidity
4. **s00n (SOON)** - Ethereum Layer 2 solution utilizing the Solana Virtual Machine

## Core Requirements

### 1. Payment Protocol
- Implement a standard URL scheme for payment requests across all SVM networks
- Support both transfer requests (non-interactive) and transaction requests (interactive)
- Enable native token transfers (SOL and network-specific tokens)
- Support SPL token transfers with proper handling of Associated Token Accounts
- Include reference fields for transaction identification and reconciliation
- Support metadata fields (label, message, memo) for transaction context

### 2. Cross-Network Compatibility
- Create a unified interface for interacting with different SVM networks
- Implement network detection and automatic routing
- Handle network-specific transaction formats and requirements
- Ensure consistent user experience across all supported networks
- Provide fallback mechanisms for network-specific features

### 3. Developer SDK
- Create a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for web applications
- Develop mobile SDKs for iOS and Android
- Implement server-side libraries for backend integration
- Provide comprehensive API documentation
- Include code examples and tutorials

### 4. UI Components
- Create ready-to-use payment buttons and forms
- Develop QR code generation and scanning components
- Implement payment status indicators and notifications
- Design responsive components for both web and mobile
- Support customization of UI elements to match application branding

### 5. One-Click Integration
- Provide simple integration methods requiring minimal code
- Create plug-and-play components for popular frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Develop plugins for e-commerce platforms
- Implement configuration-based setup with sensible defaults
- Include comprehensive documentation and guides

### 6. Security
- Implement secure transaction signing and verification
- Support multi-signature transactions
- Provide transaction validation mechanisms
- Implement fraud detection capabilities
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations

### 7. Business Features (Stripe Alternative)
- Support one-time payments
- Enable recurring payments and subscriptions
- Implement payment links and invoicing
- Provide payment analytics and reporting
- Support refunds and dispute resolution
- Include customer management features

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Fast transaction processing (< 1 second confirmation)
- Low resource utilization
- Efficient handling of concurrent transactions
- Minimal network overhead

### 2. Reliability
- High availability (99.9%+)
- Graceful error handling
- Transaction retry mechanisms
- Consistent behavior across different environments

### 3. Scalability
- Support for high transaction volumes
- Ability to handle traffic spikes
- Efficient resource utilization under load
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

### 4. Usability
- Intuitive developer experience
- Clear documentation
- Consistent API design
- Helpful error messages and debugging tools

### 5. Maintainability
- Clean, modular code structure
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Well-documented codebase
- Easy upgrade path for future enhancements

## Constraints
- Must be completely fee-free for end users and merchants
- Must work across all specified SVM networks
- Must be open-source and permissionless
- Must be compatible with existing SVM wallets
- Must not require centralized infrastructure
