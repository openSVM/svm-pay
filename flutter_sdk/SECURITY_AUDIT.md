# Security Audit Report for SVM-Pay Flutter SDK

## Overview
This document outlines security vulnerabilities, bugs, and potential improvements identified in the SVM-Pay Flutter SDK.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Insecure Address Validation
**Severity: High**
**Location: `lib/src/network_adapters.dart:28-43`**

The current base58 validation is overly simplistic and doesn't properly validate Solana address formats.

```dart
// Current implementation - VULNERABLE
bool validateAddress(String address) {
  if (address.isEmpty || address.length < 32 || address.length > 44) {
    return false;
  }
  // Only checks character set, not actual address format
}
```

**Fix Required**: Implement proper base58 decoding and checksum validation.

### 2. Insecure Random Reference Generation
**Severity: Medium**
**Location: `lib/src/svm_pay_sdk.dart:130-136`**

The reference generation uses weak randomness and is predictable.

```dart
// Current implementation - WEAK
final random = timestamp.hashCode ^ Object.hash(timestamp, DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch);
```

**Fix Required**: Use cryptographically secure random number generation.

### 3. Missing Network Timeouts
**Severity: Medium**
**Location: Native platform code**

Network operations don't have proper timeouts, leading to potential DoS attacks.

**Fix Required**: Implement proper timeout mechanisms.

### 4. Information Disclosure in Debug Logs
**Severity: Low**
**Location: Various locations with debug logging**

Debug logs may expose sensitive payment information.

**Fix Required**: Sanitize debug output.

## Logic Bugs

### 1. URL Parsing Edge Cases
**Severity: Medium**
**Location: `lib/src/svm_pay_sdk.dart:88-125`**

URL parsing doesn't handle malformed URLs properly and may crash.

### 2. Missing Input Validation
**Severity: Medium**

Many methods don't validate inputs properly before processing.

### 3. Race Conditions in Native Code
**Severity: Medium**
**Location: Platform-specific implementations**

Concurrent access to shared resources without proper synchronization.

## Recommendations

1. Implement proper cryptographic address validation
2. Use secure random number generation
3. Add comprehensive input validation
4. Implement proper timeout mechanisms
5. Add rate limiting for payment requests
6. Sanitize all debug output
7. Add proper error boundaries
8. Implement secure storage for sensitive data

## Fixed Issues

The following issues have been addressed in this audit:
- Enhanced address validation with proper base58 decoding
- Improved random number generation using secure methods
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Implemented network timeouts
- Enhanced error handling and logging
