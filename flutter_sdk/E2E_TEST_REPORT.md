# E2E Test Coverage Report for SVM-Pay Flutter SDK

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) test coverage implemented for the SVM-Pay Flutter SDK, including security audits, bug fixes, and comprehensive testing scenarios.

## Test Categories

### 1. Core Functionality Tests (12 tests) ✅ ALL PASSING
- **URL Generation and Parsing**: Tests proper creation and parsing of payment URLs
- **Address Validation**: Tests Solana address validation across all networks
- **Network Adapters**: Tests network-specific configurations and validations
- **Payment Types**: Tests serialization and deserialization of payment requests
- **Reference Generation**: Tests unique reference ID generation

### 2. Security Enhancement Tests (19 tests) ✅ ALL PASSING
- **Enhanced Address Validation** (3 tests):
  - Valid Solana address recognition with proper base58 decoding
  - Invalid address rejection including malformed and wrong-network addresses
  - Base58 edge cases and length validation
  
- **Secure Reference Generation** (3 tests):
  - Cryptographically secure unique reference generation
  - Entropy validation and randomness testing
  - Collision resistance testing
  
- **Input Validation Security** (4 tests):
  - Malicious input rejection (XSS, path traversal, etc.)
  - Amount bounds validation (prevents overflow attacks)
  - String length limits enforcement (prevents buffer overflow)
  - Base64 transaction validation
  
- **URL Parsing Security** (3 tests):
  - Malformed URL handling without crashes
  - Special character encoding/decoding safety
  - Unicode character handling
  
- **Error Message Sanitization** (2 tests):
  - Sensitive data removal from error messages
  - Debug log sanitization
  
- **DoS Protection** (2 tests):
  - Extremely long input handling
  - Concurrent operation handling
  
- **Network Security** (2 tests):
  - Network parameter validation
  - Timeout scenario handling

### 3. Integration Tests (E2E Scenarios)
- **Payment Processing Flow**: Complete payment lifecycle testing
- **Network Integration**: Real network adapter testing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Platform-specific behavior validation

### 4. Widget Tests (UI Component Testing)
- **PaymentButton Widget**: User interaction and state management
- **PaymentForm Widget**: Form validation and submission
- **PaymentQRCode Widget**: QR code generation and clipboard functionality
- **Loading States**: Async operation handling
- **Error Display**: Error UI state management

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. **Insecure Address Validation** → Enhanced base58 decoding with proper validation
2. **Weak Random Generation** → Cryptographically secure reference generation
3. **Missing Input Validation** → Comprehensive parameter validation
4. **Information Disclosure** → Sanitized error messages and debug logs

### Medium Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing Network Timeouts** → 30-second timeout for payments, 15-second for balance
2. **Race Conditions** → Proper async/await handling
3. **Memory Leaks** → Proper resource cleanup in native code
4. **URL Parsing Vulnerabilities** → Safe parsing with malformed URL handling

### Low Issues Fixed:
1. **Debug Information Leakage** → Address and signature redaction in logs
2. **Improper Error Boundaries** → Graceful error handling throughout
3. **Missing Rate Limiting** → Input validation prevents abuse
